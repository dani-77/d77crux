# d77crux

My own collection of Crux ports.
Please check dependencies prior pkgmk any of these; all are working.

Download the d77crux.httpup and copy it to /etc/ports.

```
wget http://raw.githubusercontent.com/dani-77/d77crux/master/d77crux.httpup

sudo mv d77crux.httpup /etc/ports
```

Edit /etc/prt-get.conf adding the line prtdir /usr/ports/d77crux to your configuration.

```
sudo echo prtdir /usr/ports/d77crux >> /etc/prt-get.conf
```
Update the system.

```
sudo ports -u d77crux
```

Now you can use any of my ports. 

Hope you enjoy it.
